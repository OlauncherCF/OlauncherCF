Thank you for your help in making Olauncher CF more stable and reliable!

Guide to a good crash-report:
• Please search existing bug/crash reports to avoid creating duplicates.
• Give your crash report a good name (no generics like "Error" or "Crash"), so others can easily identify the topic of your issue.
• Describe what you were doing what could've led to the crash and whether the crash is random or reproducible.
