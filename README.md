### Small Print

**Olauncher CF is under open source GPL3 license, meaning you can use, study, change and share it at will.**  
Copyleft ensures it stays that way. From the full source, anyone can build, fork and use as you wish

* Olauncher CF does not have network access.
* Olauncher CF does not transmit any data in any way whatsoever.

Olauncher CF may request permissions necessary for certain functionalities,  
without however requiring them (for its basic operation); here they are explained:

- `android.permission.EXPAND_STATUS_BAR`
	- Allows an application to expand or collapse the status bar.
- `android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES`
	- Allows query of any normal app on the device, regardless of manifest declarations. Used to show the apps list.
- `android.alarm.permission.SET_ALARM`
	- Allows an application to broadcast an Intent to set an alarm for the user. Used to open the default alarm app if no other clock app is set in the settings.
